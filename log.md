# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Working through the javascript tutorials in freecodecamp

**Time of Work**: 4pm-5pm

**Thoughts:** It is eye-opening to brush up on the basics and have "aha" moments around things I'm currently stuck on in my Dog Breed Database
